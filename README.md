# To Do List Web Application
Avi Nissim-Hart

This project is an ToDo list web appolication. Its purpose is to have a task table and a table of lists of tasks.
I used JavaScript and Java to produce a working API and making it functional within a web application.

The purpose of this project is to showcase the skills i have learnt while
training at the academy.
